PyBlackjack
===========

A small CLI blackjack game simulator written and implemented in Python.

What is this game for?
----------------------

In my everlasting quest in making my Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF101 a somewhat
capable replacement for my Thinkpad, I've decided to do this little pet project
just how useful my Transformer is for hobby software projects.

I'm not gonna make this game get any graphics whatsoever, not even ASCII art or
stuff. This is a completely text-only game, so I'm just totally gonna be
involved with the game flow and logic and probably nothing else.
